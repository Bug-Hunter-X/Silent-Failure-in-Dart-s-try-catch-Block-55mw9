# Silent Failure in Dart's try-catch Block

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart where exceptions are caught but not rethrown, leading to silent failures that are difficult to debug. The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from the lack of rethrowing the caught exception which could result in unexpected application behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`. Observe that despite a simulated network failure, no explicit error is thrown, hindering debugging. 
3. Run `bugSolution.dart`. Observe that the exception is now properly handled and rethrown.

## Solution

To avoid silent failures, always rethrow exceptions if appropriate, or implement more sophisticated error handling that ensures that errors are logged and handled in a user-friendly manner. The `bugSolution.dart` demonstrates how to fix this issue by rethrowing the exception, enabling proper error propagation and handling.
